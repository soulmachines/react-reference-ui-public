            <p>We only supply the products for domestic and private use. If you use the products for any commercial, business or re-sale purpose we will have no liability to you for any loss of profit, loss of business, business interruption, or loss of business opportunity.</p>

          <li>
            <p>Nobody else has any rights under this contract. This contract is between you and us. No other person shall have any rights to enforce any of its terms.</p>
          </li>
          <li>

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under these terms, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of your breaking this contract, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things and it will not prevent us taking steps against you at a later date.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>These Terms and any non-contractual obligations arising out of them shall be governed by and construed in accordance with New Zealand law.</p>
